Experiment Details

In the experiment, we will test the difference between two systems...
  The first system will be without the storage stone, it will on a single node consist of
    a) 1 client_modify instance which will create the instance if its the 0 value client_modify (unique number passed as an argument)
    b) nproc - 1 nodes that will listen for a final aggregated value
  There will be a special node which will host both the pds server and the aggregate stone...we may move him off node to underline the 
  storage stone highlight

  The second system will have the storage stone, in a single node we will still have a) and b) from above, but
    c) We will subscribe directly to the output channel and the modify client will publish directly to that channel
    d) One of the client_nodes will set up the storage stone...identified by the unique number passed as an argument
    e)
